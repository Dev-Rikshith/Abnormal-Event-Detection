# Abnormal-Event-Detection
Major Project on Abnormal Event detection

The detection of abnormal events from 
surveillance video input is more difficult due to the small 
number of such occurrences that may occur over time. 
Through learning a supervised model, this can be achieved 
to detect such events from video sequences. The proposed 
system used Deep learning based Convolutional Long ShortTerm Memory (Conv-LSTM) networks to learn video 
sequences as supervised models and to compute the 
regularity score from the learned frames. Any divergences 
on the computed scores represents the detection of events as 
the learning model has represented it through 
reconstruction of errors. The learned model can be chosen 
as the best model based on the detection performed through 
regularity scores. The learning videos of abnormal 
sequences are very less in real time video and which has to 
be determined through the model accurately. Thus, the 
proposed work is more challenging to get the event detection 
identification at a particular frame accurately. Auto encoder 
and decoders used in the proposed model. The model is also 
experimented on Avenue Dataset for detection of abnormal 
events. The Detection of Anomalous Occurrences from video 
sequences is accurately detected in experimental results.
